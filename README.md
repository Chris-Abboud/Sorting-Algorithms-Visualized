## Instructions

To create a fresh batch of data, use the `New Data` button located on the very right. Note that anytime the button is clicked, the number in the text box located under this button will be how many different rectangles are present. So to create a new batch of data with a different number of rectangles, first change the value of the textbox, then click the `New Data` button. Once you have your desired data, simply click any of the available 5 sorting methods and you will be able to visually see them in action.
